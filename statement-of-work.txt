1. Your Uni ID (u-number)
	u5783028

2. List the other members of your group (uni ID numbers)
	siqi zhang :u5721067

3. Briefly describe what you did for the assignment. (This can be a
   paragraph of text, or a few bullet points. It's up to you. What is
   important is that you clearly describe what was your contribution
   to the group's work. If you did something in close collaboration
   with another group member, so that you cannot clearly separate out
   who did what, then say so; for example "NNN and I wrote the user
   documentation together").)

 	* I'm responsible for writing the code of our program.
	* Most of the code was written by me, except the part using matplotlib to draw
	  some graphs 
	* The idea and algorithms of how to implement were discussed by me and siqi together
	* The docstring of each function was written by me as well, but in-line comments were done by 		  siqi.
